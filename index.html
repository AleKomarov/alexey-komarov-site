      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Alexey Komarov (also known as Alexey Brandner, his great-grandfather's surname) is a composer from Odessa, by the Black Sea. He holds a higher musical education and is a trained flutist with qualifications as a teacher, chamber ensemble performer, and soloist in an orchestra.
      </p>
      <p>
        His music resists stylistic boundaries, embracing a cinematic approach. At the heart of his work lies a devotion to melodiousness, beauty, and expressiveness — values he unapologetically champions in an age often obsessed with trends.

      <h2>Creative Journey</h2>
      <p>
        His musical path began in early childhood, surrounded by family and music. At a family celebration, he amused relatives by pretending to conduct Paul Mauriat's orchestra as it played from his grandfather’s vinyl record player.
